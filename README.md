### The Why: 
For our final project in ASE 230 (Full Stack Application Development), we were tasked to team up with our peers and...
- Design and implement a RESTful API with Node.js + Express.
- Persist and query data with MongoDB.
- Protect routes with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and session management.
- Combine the server-side component with the existing front end to provide a cohesive user experience.

We decided to create a platform that assists college students in preparing for job interviews. This project aims to provide resources, practice questions, and tips to help students succeed in their job search.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Mock Interviews** *coming soon!*: A feature that allows students to practice interviews with feedback from AI.
- **Interview Questions** *coming soon!*: A comprehensive list of common interview questions categorized by industry and job role.
- **Resume Builder** *coming soon!*: Tools and templates to help students create professional resumes.
